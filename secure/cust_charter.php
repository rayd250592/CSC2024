	    	Raymond's PC's staff understand the importance of ensuring that they arrive at your home or business as quickly as possible and at the time agreed.
	     	We aim to repair 99% of issues without having to take any equipment away. 
	     	In the rare event that any equipment that is taken away for repair or further diagnosis, we will provide you with an expectation of when it will be returned.
			Where spare parts need to be sourced, your PC PAL Engineers aim to carry an extensive range of spare parts. 
			If we need to order specific parts, we will contact you to gain authorisation (with estimated time of arrival) for delivery upon acceptance of our quotation for parts.
