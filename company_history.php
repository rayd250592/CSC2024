<p>Raymond's PC's opened it doors in 2001. We have been trading now for nearly 10yrs.</p>
<p>We started off with small premises which served their purpose for 7 years. We finally outgrew these and moved to brand new purpose built retail unit just 300yards from our old place.  We felt it was important not to lose our considerable customer base by moving too far.</p>

<p>At nearly 5 times the size of the old premises we believe it would give us the opportunity to give a better choice with more stock and a bigger and better workshop.</p>
<p>Having been in the new premises for 2 years now we can say it was a worthwile move.</p>
